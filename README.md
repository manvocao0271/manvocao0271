## Hello and welcome to my GitHub!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Man, and I am a Rutgers University - New Brunswick trained computer scientist interested in all things Python & Machine Learning! I have a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science with an adjacent focus in Mathematics at my latest university!

Here are some fun facts about me:

- In the past I have built a daily journal web application that aids users in pursuring their goal! Using Render to host the website and Groq API, I created an AI-powered companion that helps break down the user's goal into a planned regiment. Check it out [here](https://days-counting-web-app-w-render.onrender.com/) and let me know what you think!

- I am currently working on an educational platform that is for beginners and curious users wanting to learn trading in the financial stock market. This platform is being designed to simulate real-world market data with an AI agent that helps make financial decisions! Check it out [here](https://github.com/manvocao0271/stock-market-educational-platform), working website will be deployed soon!
